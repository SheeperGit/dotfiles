# Launch a Game #
#################

# Usage: 
#   game
#
# Description: 
#   Launches a game either locally (via a symlink or launcher script for the game)
#   or through Steam. In either case, the user is prompted for the game name to launch.
#
#   If launched locally, files in `GAME_DIR` are assumed to be either symlinks or 
#   launcher scripts to the selected game. 
#
#   If launched through Steam, the user is prompted to type the game name and 
#   select from a list of games closely matching the previous prompt to launch
#   the game. The game is launched through Steam, but without the GUI.
